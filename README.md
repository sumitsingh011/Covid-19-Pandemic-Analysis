# Covid-19 Pandemic Analysis
**Overview**
- The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global health, economies, and daily life since 
its outbreak in late 2019. Understanding the progression of the virus through data analysis is essential 
for monitoring trends, assessing policy impacts, and guiding public health responses. This project 
involves the systematic analysis of COVID-19 data using Microsoft Excel to uncover meaningful 
insights into the spread, mortality, and recovery patterns of the virus across several countries. By 
utilizing various Excel tools such as pivot tables, graphs, and formulas, this analysis enables us to 
observe trends over time, compare data between countries, calculate mortality and recovery rates, 
and visualize daily new cases and deaths. The ultimate goal of this project is to transform raw data 
into actionable information that can inform decision-making and enhance understanding of the 
pandemic’s global dynamics.


**Dataset**
-The dataset used in this project is manually curated to represent realistic and illustrative COVID-19 
statistics between April 1 and April 8, 2020. The dataset includes the following columns for each country 
on each day: 
• Date: The calendar date of the report 
• Country: The name of the country 
• Total Cases: The cumulative number of confirmed cases to date 
• New Cases: The number of new confirmed cases reported on that day 
• Total Deaths: The cumulative number of deaths due to COVID-19 
• New Deaths: The number of new deaths reported on that day 
• Total Recovered: The total number of people who have recovered from the virus 
• Active Cases: The number of active infections on that day 
The dataset includes data for five countries—USA, India, Brazil, Spain, and Italy—spanning eight days. 
It was saved and analyzed in Excel format, with all calculations, visualizations, and reports generated 
within the same workbook.


**Conclusion**
- The COVID-19 analysis project successfully demonstrates how Microsoft Excel can be used as a 
powerful tool for data analysis even with large datasets. By collecting, organizing, and analyzing 
pandemic-related data, we were able to gain valuable insights into how the virus spread and impacted 
different countries over time. 
From calculating recovery and mortality rates to visualizing trends through graphs, this project 
highlighted the importance of data-driven approaches in understanding public health crises. While the 
dataset used is limited and illustrative, the methods applied can be extended to real-time data from 
sources like WHO or Johns Hopkins University. 
Through this analysis, we not only reinforced Excel skills but also recognized how crucial data analysis 
is in informing decisions during global emergencies. This project stands as a foundational example of 
how accessible tools can contribute meaningfully to serious global issues through structured data insight.
